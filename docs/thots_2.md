# Taking Notes on Raph Koster

Okay so we want to encourage players towards some sort of goal. So progress or showing how they can get there is useful.

What does progress mean? It means players should work towards better understanding the game, and better knowledge of how things work. It means they should be less suprised over time, as they make better predictions.

For STOMP, this means we need:
- to change how players interact with the game (e.g. difficulty curve)
- to give them more complex patterns to undersand and deal with

To this end, we want to give them feedback about how well they are doing (experience design matters here).
