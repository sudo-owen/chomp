### WTF IS STOMP

Stomp is a fully onchain game heavily inspired by monster battlers like Pokemon. It's turn-based and PVP. You build a team of mons, and you battle against other people in real time.

I want Stomp to be an exciting technical milestone in the legacy of interesting EVM applications. I realize this is ambitious and maybe a little crazy.

We have collectively as an industry tried to make web3 gaming a "thing" for the past 3 cycles. Teams have raised $XXX million collectively to fund various games and/or studios. And almost all of them have shutdown.
