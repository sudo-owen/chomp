## Effects

Storm --> Rename to Overclock (your team becomes overclocked)

# Inutia
Add swap move (remove shrine strike)

# Malalien
- Infinite Love: 2 -> 3 stamina [x]

# Iblivion:
Full rework as Baselight required attacking which meant every other turn you had to swap moves. 
NEW Ability: Baselight, starts at 1, gain 1 stack at the end of each turn, up to a max of 3.
CONSIDER: making consuming the stack optional
- Brightback: consumes 1 stack to heal for 50% of damage dealt, power 70, stamina 2
- NEW Move: Unbounded Strike: consumes 3 stacks, power 130, stamina 3, otherwise power 80, stamina 2 
- NEW Move: Renormalize, Raises all stats by X0% where X is Baselight level. Fails if already active.
- NEW Move: Loop, 1 stamina, sets Baselight level to be 3 (i.e. triggers up to 2 heal stacks), -1 priority

# Embursa
- Change ability from Split The Pot to something different
    - NEW Ability: Tinderclaws
    After every move, Embursa has a 1/3 chance of getting burned. When burned, Embursa gains a 50% SpATK boost. 
    When resting, Embursa heals from burn.

# Volthare:
Storm on switch in is a little too strong given the lack of other speed tiers / priority moves.
- Fix dual shock to correctly inflict Zap on self at end of turn
- NEW Ability: Preemptive Shock: On switch in (after the first one), deals a small amount of damage to the opposing mon.
CONSIDER: renaming Storm to be something that implies it isn't global (both teams can have an instance active)
- NEW Move: Overclock, sets Overclock on the battlefield. Overclock lasts 5 turns, boosts Speed and decreases Def and ZDef.
- NEW Move: tbd
- Rename Move: Megavoltage: Clears Storm and deals massive damage, otherwise accuracy is 50%
