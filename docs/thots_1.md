# Expanding the game

We want to let people unlock new mons in a fun way. How do we enable that?

Through gameplay. But what sort of gameplay?

When playing with friends, they should aim to win. Or they can play against the CPU. How can we make this easy?

Easiest is just to see if you win a game or not.

But what makes the game fun? Like what should people even be able to do?

The game is fun because it is:
- a tactical turn based game where you can make decisions that matter and plan out over multiple turns

Is that enough?

I'm very hesitant and skeptical of the idea that you need to provide lots and lots of things. Or an assortment. But it is true that having a mix of things will be more interesting.

But we have to start with one thing. If we take the battle flow to be the fundamental unit, then everything has to be in service of that.

We have to add additional ways to shake up the battles, etc. etc.

To that end, having a buff/debuff mode with the centralized price oracle is definitely interesting. 

Also you just need to improve access so that more people can try things out.

Okay, but if you were to add some things, I think the main things are progression and making people feel like they can get stronger.

There is a feeling of envy, or rather comparison. If you see someone with something, you also want it. That's fine, we just need to make it attainable.

Okay, so now we can talk a bit more structure. What we want are ways to hook into the battle, make people care about the outcome, and then make the game more interesting.

There are currently a few ironclad rules about the way that mons and stats are handled:

- mons are not tradeable
- mons do not get stronger
- mons are not permissionless (yet)

breaking each one of these opens up new avenues, but not in ways that feel great.

- making mons tradeable directly invites a basic economy. and while it can be fun to let people trade, trading is also a game. so there can not be a market until the game is fun, otherwise the market becomes the game.

- mons do not get stronger. mons can get stronger, but this will favor players who automate or run bots. you can have light progression with rate limits so that even automation is not progressing too much faster.

- mons are not permissionless, which is similar to mons not being in a market. if mons were permissionless, people could try and make their own game. in practice, they do not do very well.

okay, so none of these seem ideal off the bat, but we can probably adjust them a bit to make them less toxic:

- instead of making mons themselves tradeable, we could have buffs that are tradeable. this still leads to certain items being more desirous (which is fine), but then trying to make them tradeable will still lead to the market issue.

one counterpoint is that in the game, it can be fun to trade mons. but we will need more mons. otherwise, it's not worth it. trading when there are 64 mons and you are 12 away is very fun. maybe. but trading when there are 12 is kinda pointless.

so idt there's a reason to have trading for now.

okay, but then how do people get mons? how can we tie things into progression?

Okay so here's a more concrete plan:
Every battle, you get assigned an objective (e.g. win with this mon, in this way?) Is that interesting. I guess it is in that it forces you to try out each on. Is it better to just have everyone with a different random chain, and the goal is to win with the previous mon they unlocked? Maybe that's pretty easy. Play a match each day, earn points. If you use the newest guy, you get more points.

Okay, what else is the reason to use a mon? Well, if there was more content. Right now, that's just more mons. Is there a way you could have them stronger? I guess you could have some +/- 10% boosts that you could apply to your mon. (e.g. +10% here, -10% here). In those cases, it could be between ATK, DEF, SPD, and HP (both special and normal are affected) 

If you win X games with each mon, you unlock the trait slider where you can add 10% to 1 trait and reduce another by 10%. Is that too much? Maybe not? Basically has 4 choose 2 which is 6 different outcomes per mon. Which seems like a good enough set of loadouts?

Okay, and do they all get another ability? I don't know if they can because that changes up some of the ways that moves and abilities interplay. But we could give each mon a 5th move, that they unlock.

Okay so you progress along this curve where you can unlock:
- stat shift +/-
- new move
- new color palette

cool, is that enough to go on? probably...

Okay, so then the next thing is, what screens, what modalities, what ways, can people interact?

Right now there is just the battle mode. How do you give people immersion? how do you make them care?
