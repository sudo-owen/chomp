# Patch 1

## Effects

Zap:
- When applied, stays. At beginning of turn, clears and applies skipTurn flag. (Vs clearing at end of turn and applying flag)

## Mons

Ghouliath:
Hard to find a current niche, making their gameplay more toxic (e.g. status spam) to see how everything comes together
- Reduce damage (120 -> 80), up burn chance (30-->50) for infernal flame
- Add +1 priority to Eternal Grudge (makes it more like a bomb that can go off at any point) [x]

Inutia:
Generally strong in terms of passing buffs to sweepers, but other moves aren't getting enough usage. Making Initialize more situational, and buffing Chain Expansion massively.
- Remove shrine strike
- Increase stamina cost for Initialize (1 to 3) [x]
- Reduce cost for Chain Expansion (4 to 1) [x]
- Add in new move to be damage + swap (2 stamina cost)

Malalien:
Generally at a good level of power for a glass cannon, one shots a little too easily. Debuffing moves to make spamming just a bit more difficult.
- Infinite Love: 2 -> 3 stamina
- Federal Investigation: 3 -> 4 stamina

Iblivion:
Full rework as Baselight required attacking which meant every other turn you had to swap moves. 
NEW Ability: Baselight, starts at 1, gain 1 stack at the end of each turn, up to a max of 3. When gaining a Baselight stack, gain 5/7/10% of max HP.
CONSIDER: making consuming the stack optional 
- Removing Loop as it is strictly better than resting
- Removing Baselight as a move
- Brightback: consumes 1 stack to heal for 50% of damage dealt, power 70, stamina 2
- NEW Move: Unbounded Strike: consumes 3 stacks, power 130, stamina 3, otherwise power 80, stamina 2 
- NEW Move: Renormalize, Raises all stats by X0% where X is Baselight level. Fails if already active.
- NEW Move: Loop, 1 stamina, sets Baselight level to be 3 (i.e. triggers up to 2 heal stacks), -1 priority

Gorillax
Good enough level of power, might be a bit overtuned, but will keep as-is for now.

Sofabbi
Not enough moves to take advantage of Carrot Harvest, increasing both power and stamina of unexpected carrot to counter
- Unexpected Carrot power 80 -> 120, stamina 2 -> 5 [x]

Pengym
- NEW Ability: At end of round, if opponent has Frostbite, gain 10% speed and attack.
- NEW Move: 

Embursa
- reduce Q5 stamina cost to be 2, encourage using it more often [x]

Volthare:
Storm on switch in is a little too strong given the lack of other speed tiers / priority moves.
- Fix dual shock to correctly inflict Zap on self at end of turn
- NEW Ability: Preemptive Shock: On switch in (after the first one), deals a small amount of damage to the opposing mon.
CONSIDER: renaming Storm to be something that implies it isn't global (both teams can have an instance active)
- NEW Move: Synthesize Storm, sets Storm on the battlefield. Storm lasts 5 turns, boosts Speed and decreases Def and ZDef.
- NEW Move: Aftershock: deals damage for 3 turns, 2 stamina. Power is boosted by Storm. Subsequent moves only refresh the duration and do not stack.
- Rename Move: Megavoltage: Clears Storm and deals massive damage, otherwise accuracy is 50%

Aurox: NEW MON
Type: Metal
Aurox is designed to be a tanky. Limited offensive options, but a strong defensive option, hard countering most status effects.
- Ability: Long and Strong
After taking damage, depending on amount of damage taken, Aurox gains % Attack boost. (0.25% attack boost for each % in health lost)
- Moves:
- Volatile Punch: 3 stamina, 50 power, 15% chance of Burn, 15% chance of Frostbite for self and opponent
- Gilded Recovery: 2 stamina. Select a mon and heal it of any status conditions. If successful, Aurox also heals 50% of max HP and the healed mon gets +1 stamina.
- Iron Wall: 2 stamina, Until the end of next turn, when Aurox takes damage, heal 50% of it.
- Bull Rush: 3 stamina, 80 power, deals damage
