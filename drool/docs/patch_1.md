# Patch 1

Ghouliath:
Hard to find a current niche, making their gameplay more toxic (e.g. status spam) to see how everything comes together
- Reduce damage (120 -> 80), up burn chance (30-->50) for infernal flame
- Add +1 priority to Eternal Grudge (makes it more like a bomb that can go off at any point)

Inutia:
Generally strong in terms of passing buffs to sweepers, but other moves aren't getting enough usage. Making Initialize more situational, and buffing Chain Expansion massively.
- Remove shrine strike
- Increase stamina cost for Initialize (1 to 3)
- Reduce cost for Chain Expansion (4 to 1)
- Add in new move to be damage + swap (2 stamina cost)

Malalien:
Generally at a good level of power for a glass cannon, one shots a little too easily. Debuffing moves to make spamming just a bit more difficult.
- Infinite Love: 2 -> 3 stamina
- Federal Investigation: 3 -> 4 stamina

Iblivion:
Full rework as Baselight required attacking which meant every other turn you had to swap moves. 
NEW Ability: Baselight, starts at 1, gain 1 stack at the end of each turn, up to a max of 3. When gaining a Baselight stack, if there's at least 1 stack, heal for 10% of max HP.
CONSIDER: making consuming the stack optional 
- Removing Loop as it is strictly better than resting
- Removing Baselight as a move
- Brightback: consumes 1 stack to heal for 50% of damage dealt, power 70, stamina 2
- NEW Move: Unbounded Strike: consumes 3 stacks, power 130, stamina 2, otherwise power 80, stamina 2 
- NEW Move: Renormalize, Raises all stats by X0% where X is Baselight level. Fails if already active.
- NEW Move: Loop, 1 stamina, sets Baselight level to be 3 (i.e. triggers up to 2 heal stacks), -1 priority

Gorillax
Good enough level of power, might be a bit overtuned, but will keep as-is for now.

Sofabbi
Not enough moves to take advantage of Carrot Harvest, increasing both power and stamina of unexpected carrot to counter
- Unexpected Carrot power 80 -> 120, stamina 2 -> 5

Pengym
Deep Freeze and Frosbite tradeoff is again not a fun one, so changing that to make frostbite trigger more incidentally
TBD

Embursa
Not enough gameplay data, no changes for now, but changes might be made in a later patch

Volthare:
Storm on switch in is a little too strong given the lack of other speed tiers / priority moves.
- Fix dual shock to correctly inflict Zap on self at end of turn
- NEW Ability: tbd
- NEW Move: Summon Storm, sets Storm on the battlefield
- NEW Move: tbd

Aurox: NEW MON
