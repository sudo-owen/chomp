# TODO

1) Add max timeout of 1 hr for battles, allow forcible end
- Add bulk forcible end call
2) Simplify gacha flow dramatically

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LATER FEATURES

0) fix the rng issue in the way StandardAttack decides which effects to apply (rn if an attack is only X% accurate, and an effect has a Y% chance, the lower X is, the higher Y should be (they shld be independent but we use the same rng source currently))
- should fix this, but am afraid of tests needing to be rewritten.

KNOWN BUGGY INTERACTIONS

1) If a move forces a switch and triggers before the other player can make its move, then the new mon will try to execute its move still
- The Engine handles the case where the stamina is insufficient (it just skips the move)

Ways to mitigate:
- avoid forcing opponent swap outs unless it's at low priority
- have the engine set the skipTurn flag on newly swapped in mons (if they have yet to run their turn yet)
    - look into this later
    - or do this w/ a custom condition that can set the flag, and then remove at end of turn

2) If an effect calls dealDamage() and triggers AfterDamage, it can potentially cause an infinite loop!
(either if it calls dealDamage() on the opposing mon who also has a damaging attack with an AfterDamage trigger)

Ways to mitigate:
- deal damage directly (but skip calling dealDamage) on the Engine
- avoid dealing damage in the afterDamage hook itself
- maintain manual mutex to prevent infinite recurse

4) Malicious p0 can commit to a team that has an array of mons, but modify the mon moves prior to starting a battle (after p1 commits)

Ways to mitigate:
- Need to handle on the team registry angle probably
- Atm, restricting it to the same array of mon indices reduces the attack surface somewhat
- OR, just add the move indices to the integrity hash
